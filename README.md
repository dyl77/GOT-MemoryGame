# Game of Thrones Memory Game
This is a small Java based memory card game, that utilizes the Java Swing API to create a GUI for the user to interact with.
The game has a Game of Thrones theme, with the faces of the cards being Great House Sigils from the series.
It is played by clicking a card out of the 4x4 array, and attempt to match the cards to one another.
If the wrong two cards are selected, then the cards then return to their original position, but if cards are matched they are removed from the selection.
Match all cards to win the game and the Iron Throne!
